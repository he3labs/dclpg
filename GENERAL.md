## Why Use ClickLok
When presenting frequently the computer being used is being used for multiple purposes. Applications will display notifications, OS updates, or simply multi-tasking. Each of these can disrupt the presentation, but causing the presentation no longer to be the top window. When this happens the remote can no longer control the presentation

### ClickLok Solution

ClickLok monitors the system and when it receives a click from the remote it makes sure the presentation is on top and receives the remote's click

### This Seems Easy

In earlier versions of Windows this was fairly simple to accomplish, however with Windows 10 and beyond, the solution is quite involved, ClickLok takes a lot of effort to make sure it works seamlessly. Even the differences between Windows 10 and 11 involved a large amount of work


## Monitoring

When presenting multiple things that can effect the presentation, and cause issues, ClickLok not only resolves the main issues that can occur, but adding monitoring also helps you quickly diagnose and fix many of the common ones

| Issue  | Monitoring / Solution |
|--------|-------------------|
| Are Remote's Batteries Dead?                          | ***Displays*** last Remote key sent & Timing  ***NoKeySent***(RemoteOutOfRange/BatteriesDead)   |
| Which Presentation is remote connected to        | ***Displays*** Presentation name Selected |
| Multi-tasking on presentation computer         | ***Redirects*** ClickLok sets Presentation to be the focus and sends the remote's click    |
| Presenation Fullscreen               | ***Displays***  last Remote key sent & Timing in taskbar monitor (visible on multi monitor systems)|

## FAQs

Due to the way Windows works this App is complex and took a long time to create. Like any business we need it to earn enough to pay for its creation and be maintained.


### I only have a single monitor, is ClickLok Pro still useful for me

> Yes, ClickLok's primary function is to make sure each time you press the remote, the presentation advances, even if something something on the computer made the presentation go into the background. This still works fine if you only have a single Monitor. 

> If you want to be able to see ClickLok info, while running with a single screen you have two options. (1) If using a projector, Make the Projector the second screen and display the presentation on the projector only. (2) Although usually used for diagnosing issues, ClickLok will float above your presentation if not minimized
