# ClickLok Standard (Non-Stop Presentations)

This is the Standard Version of the application – It is optimized for those who present and need to make sure nothing interrupts their presentation. Whether it’s a notification, a new app or even someone using the machine while the presentation is running ClickLok has you covered.

The App is designed to make sure when you advance the presentation using a remote each time the button is clicked, that click goes to the presentation.

## Overview

ClickLok performs a very complex job, but we have worked hard to make using it fast and simple. 
Making it work seamlessly for users is our goal.

- For most users - there is just one button to click
- If you want to manually select the Presentation then you need to choose which presentation


> **NOTE:** For a great majority, <b><font color='green'>Simple Operations</font></b> is all you actually need to read!
>
> The program has lots of depth and you can do a lot with it. However, for most it just works out of the box not changes needed. 
> We know that some love the details of all features, for you we have added a full manual.

## FAQs

### I only have a single monitor, is ClickLok still useful for me

> Yes, ClickLok's primary function is to make sure each time you press the remote, the presentation advances, even if something something on the computer made the presentation go into the background. This still works fine if you only have a single Monitor. 

> If you want to be able to see ClickLok info, while running with a single screen you have two options. (1) If using a projector, Make the Projector the second screen and display the presentation on the projector only. (2) Although usually used for diagnosing issues, ClickLok will float above your presentation if not minimized
