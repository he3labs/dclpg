# ClickLok Pro (Non-Stop Presentations)

This is the Pro Version of the application – It is optimized for professionals who present more frequently or are in a setting where the presentation computer may also, be the machine used for streaming or other AV activities. 

The App is designed to make sure when you advance the presentation using a remote each time the button is clicked, that click goes to the presentation. 


## Overview

ClickLok performs a very complex job, but we have worked hard to make using it fast and simple. 
Making it work seamlessly for users is our goal.

- For most users - there is just one button to click
- If you want to manually select the Presentation then you need to choose which presentation


> **NOTE:** For a great majority, <b><font color='green'>Simple Operations</font></b> is all you actually need to read!
>
> The program has lots of depth and you can do a lot with it. However, for most it just works out of the box not changes needed. 
> We know that some love the details of all features, for you we have added a full manual.

2) Monitor 2 - Click on Right Taskbar Icon to restore ClickLok

## Configuration

The Pro Version of the application allows several advanced features to make your life easier.
We provide defaults, but know everyone works differently, so have several options if you so desire.

![Configuration](media/configuration.png)

Some of the extras you 
can configure are:
 
- Find Modes 
- Themes
- Taskbar Info
- AutoStart
- Key Capture




### Find Modes

![Find Modes](media/findmodes.png)

Display Different Auto Find Modes

### Themes

- Colorful

![Available Themes](media/themes.png)

### Taskbar Info

Configure what type of information is being displayed on the taskbar while presentation running

![Config Taskbar](media/configtaskbar.png)

### AutoStart


- No Auto Start

![Config AutoStart](media/configautostart.png)

- View in Notification Tray, on Taskbar when PowerPoint Presenting

![Config AutoRun 1](media/autorun1.png)

- View in Notification Tray, and always show on taskbar (_It always shows even when not using PowerPoint_)

![Config AutoRun 2](media/autorun2.png)

- View in Notification Tray Only

![Config AutoRun 3](media/autorun3.png)

_(#1 or #3 are recommended. They stay out of the way, while keeping your presentations running smoothly)_

### Key Capture
(Advanced Setting)

![Config Key Capture Display](media/keycapture.png)

**This is an advanced setting** that very few people will want to modify.

The setting allows you to stop receiving key input from a **Remote** control. 

Almost all presentation remotes do not require drivers to be installed. 
This feature works because they register as a keyboard and send **PageUp** and **PageDown** Keystrokes to control presentations. 
For ClickLok to do its magic, it captures these keystrokes. 


!> NOTE: Stopping Remote Key Capture, pauses ClickLok.


If you have someone running your presentation computer, and multi-tasking between programs, <u>there is an extremely small chance,</u> the other program required the PageUp and PageDown keys to work. 

<br>

**HOWEVER, if this is the case for you, here is how you use this feature**
1) In Config, Set the Start/Stop Button to be Shown
2) While presenting, from the ClickLok Pro window Click on the Stop Button
3) Preform the Action in the other program using the **PageUp** & **PageDown** Buttons
4) From ClickLok Pro Click the Start button to un-pause ClickLok

?> Remember while ClickLok paused, it cannot protect your presentation from interruptions. 

<br>



## Controlling other Software

The pro version of ClickLok allows
- Sending keystrokes to any application you would like, which allows you to control presentations using various applications like **LibreOffice**, **OpenOffice**, **OnlyOffice** etc.
- Allows control of non Fullscreen PowerPoint Presentations.

In fact - ClickLok Pro can control any application that accepts **PageUp** & **PageDown** key control. 

### The Process

From the Main ClickLok Pro screen 
1. Un-check the PowerPoint filter

![Unslect Both Filters](media/prounselect.png)

2. Click on the **Find Presentations** Button
3. From the Dialog select the window that you wish to Control

![Manual Select](media/manualselect.png)

4. Click on the ℹ️ button the **&lt; Page Up** and **Page Down &gt;** buttons to test if the application accepts Keystrokes control.

![Info Dialog](media/proinfodialog.png)

5. <u>If control works</u> ***Close*** _the Selected Presentation Info window and run presentation as normal._ <u>If control does not work</u>, _use **Find Presentations** again and select a different window._


<br>

## FAQs


### I only have a single monitor, is ClickLok Pro still useful for me

> Yes, ClickLok's primary function is to make sure each time you press the remote, the presentation advances, even if something something on the computer made the presentation go into the background. This still works fine if you only have a single Monitor. 

> If you want to be able to see ClickLok info, while running with a single screen you have two options. (1) If using a projector, Make the Projector the second screen and display the presentation on the projector only. (2) Although usually used for diagnosing issues, ClickLok will float above your presentation if not minimized

### I like the program, but am too busy to set it up each time I go to present

> AutoRun is just what you want, go to Configuration in the Menu and then turn on AutoRun

### Is there a way where when presenting, to switch Presentations, without stopping and reselecting the presentation with ClickLok Pro?
